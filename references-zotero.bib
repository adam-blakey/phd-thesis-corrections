To measure oxygen uptake of term human fetuses and compare the values between those delivered vaginally following normal labor and those delivered by cesarean section before the onset of labor.               Design               . This was a prospective cross‐sectional study.               Setting               . University teaching hospital.               Sample               . Twenty healthy pregnant women at term (38–42 weeks) were included in this study. Among them, 10 were delivered by elective cesarean section and 10 had normal vaginal delivery.               Methods               . Umbilical vein volume blood flow was measured {$<$}24 hours before delivery. Immediately after delivery, the fetal weight was determined, and the umbilical venous and arterial blood samples were obtained. Blood gas analysis was performed and hemoglobin content was measured. Fetal oxygen uptake was calculated as a product of umbilical venous blood flow and the difference in the umbilical arterial and venous oxygen content.               Results               . We found that the mean oxygen uptake in human fetuses at term (median gestational age 39 weeks) to be 6.58 ml/min/kg (i.e. 0.29 mmol/min/kg). There was no significant difference in oxygen uptake between fetuses delivered following uncomplicated normal labor and those delivered by elective cesarean section before the onset of labor.               Conclusion               . Oxygen uptake of the appropriately grown normal human fetus at term is approximately 6.6 ml/kg/min and is not significantly affected by normal labor and delivery. Human fetuses tolerate intermittent reductions in uterine blood flow and oxygen supply associated with myometrial contractions during normal labor quite well.},

It consists of a short historical review followed by a detailed description of a recently developed multidimensional moving mesh finite element method based on conservation. Finite element algorithms are derived for both mass-conserving and non mass-conserving problems, and results shown for a number of multidimensional nonlinear test problems, including the second order porous medium equation and the fourth order thin film equation as well as a two-phase problem. Further applications and extensions are referenced.},

The efflux is greatly enhanced over the value it would have if the block were impermeable, indicating the presence of a boundary layer in the block. The velocity presumably changes across this layer from its (statistically average) Darcy value to some slip value immediately outside the permeable block. A simple theory based on replacing the effect of the boundary layer with a slip velocity proportional to the exterior velocity gradient is proposed and shown to be in reasonable agreement with experimental results.},

  abstract = {We present, on the simplest possible case, what we consider as the very basic features of the (brand new) virtual element method. As the readers will easily recognize, the virtual element method could easily be regarded as the ultimate evolution of the mimetic finite differences approach. However, in their last step they became so close to the traditional finite elements that we decided to use a different perspective and a different name. Now the virtual element spaces are just like the usual finite element spaces with the addition of suitable non-polynomial functions. This is far from being a new idea. See for instance the very early approach of E. Wachspress [A Rational Finite Element Basic (Academic Press, 1975)] or the more recent overview of T.-P. Fries and T. Belytschko [The extended/generalized finite element method: An overview of the method and its applications, Int. J. Numer. Methods Engrg.84 (2010) 253–304]. The novelty here is to take the spaces and the degrees of freedom in such a way that the elementary stiffness matrix can be computed without actually computing these non-polynomial functions, but just using the degrees of freedom. In doing that we can easily deal with complicated element geometries and/or higher-order continuity conditions (like C               1               , C               2               , etc.). The idea is quite general, and could be applied to a number of different situations and problems. Here however we want to be as clear as possible, and to present the simplest possible case that still gives the flavor of the whole idea.},

  abstract = {Pathology of the Human Placenta remains the most comprehensive and authoritative text in the field. It provides extensive information on the normal placenta, encompassing physiology, metabolism, and endocrinology, and covers placental diseases in great detail. The conditions discussed include shape aberrations, villous alterations and maldevelopment, erythroblastosis fetalis and hydrops fetalis, transplacental hemorrhage, fetal storage disorders, diverse maternal diseases, and infectious diseases. Further chapters are devoted to abortions, molar pregnancies, trophoblastic neoplasms, benign tumors, and multiple pregnancies. Legal considerations are carefully explored, and this new edition also includes a completely new chapter on artificial reproductive technology. In other respects, too, the book has been extensively revised and expanded, with wide-ranging updates that reflect the most recent progress in the field. Some 800 illustrations are included, many of them in color. The detailed index has been further improved and tables updated. Pathology of the Human Placenta will be of enormous value to pathologists and obstetrician-gynecologists alike},

  abstract = {We consider the interaction between a free flowing fluid and a porous medium flow, where the free flowing fluid is described using the time dependent Stokes equations, and the porous medium flow is described using Darcy's law in the primal formulation. To solve this problem numerically, we use a diffuse interface approach, where the weak form of the coupled problem is written on an extended domain which contains both Stokes and Darcy regions. This is achieved using a phase-field function which equals one in the Stokes region and zero in the Darcy region, and smoothly transitions between these two values on a diffuse region of width \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(\textbackslash epsilon)\$ around the Stokes-Darcy interface. We prove convergence of the diffuse interface formulation to the standard, sharp interface formulation, and derive rates of convergence. This is performed by deriving a priori error estimates for discretizations of the diffuse interface method, and by analyzing the modeling error of the diffuse interface approach at the continuous level. The convergence rates are also shown computationally in a numerical example.},

  abstract = {Epidemiological evidence links an individual's susceptibility to chronic disease in adult life to events during their intrauterine phase of development. Biologically this should not be unexpected, for organ systems are at their most plastic when progenitor cells are proliferating and differentiating. Influences operating at this time can permanently affect their structure and functional capacity, and the activity of enzyme systems and endocrine axes. It is now appreciated that such effects lay the foundations for a diverse array of diseases that become manifest many years later, often in response to secondary environmental stressors. Fetal development is underpinned by the placenta, the organ that forms the interface between the fetus and its mother. All nutrients and oxygen reaching the fetus must pass through this organ. The placenta also has major endocrine functions, orchestrating maternal adaptations to pregnancy and mobilizing resources for fetal use. In addition, it acts as a selective barrier, creating a protective milieu by minimizing exposure of the fetus to maternal hormones, such as glucocorticoids, xenobiotics, pathogens, and parasites. The placenta shows a remarkable capacity to adapt to adverse environmental cues and lessen their impact on the fetus. However, if placental function is impaired, or its capacity to adapt is exceeded, then fetal development may be compromised. Here, we explore the complex relationships between the placental phenotype and developmental programming of chronic disease in the offspring. Ensuring optimal placentation offers a new approach to the prevention of disorders such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity, which are reaching epidemic proportions.},

  abstract = {The human placenta is characterised by a unique circulatory arrangement, with numerous villous trees containing fetal vessels immersed in maternal blood. Placental tissue therefore manifests a multiscale structure balancing microscopic delivery of nutrients and macroscopic flow. The aims of this study are to examine the interaction between these scales and to understand the influence of placental organisation on the effectiveness of nutrient uptake, which can be compromised in pathologies like pre-eclampsia and diabetes. We first systematically analyse solute transport by a unidirectional flow past an array of microscopic sinks, taking up a dissolved nutrient or gas, for both regular and random sink distributions. We classify distinct asymptotic transport regimes, each characterised by the dominance of advective, diffusive or uptake effects at the macroscale, and analyse a set of simplified model problems to assess the accuracy of homogenization approximations as a function of governing parameters (Peclet and Damkohler numbers) and the statistical properties of the sink distribution. The difference between the leading-order homogenization approximation and the exact solute distribution is determined by large spatial gradients at the scale of individual villi (depending on transport parameter values) and substantial fluctuations that can be correlated over lcngthscales comparable to the whole domain. In addition, we consider the nonlinear advective effects of solute-carriers, such as red blood cells carrying oxygen. Homogenization of the solute-carrier-facilitated transport introduces an effective Peclet number that depends on the slowly varying leading-order concentration, so that an asymptotic transport regime can be changed within the domain. At large Peclet and Damkohler numbers (typical for oxygen transport in the human placenta), nonlinear advection due to solute-carriers leads to a more uniform solute distribution than for a linear carrier-free transport, suggesting a "homogenizing" effect of red blood cells on placental oxygen transport. We then use image analysis and homogenization concepts to extract the effective transport properties (diffusivity and hydraulic resistance) from the microscopic images of histological sections of the normal human placenta. The resulting two-dimensional tensor quantities allow us to assess the anisotropy of placental tissue for solute transport. We also show how the pattern of villous centres of mass can be characterised using an integral correlation measure, and identify the minimum spatial scale over which the distribution of villous branches appears statistically homogeneous. Finally, we propose a mathematical model for maternal blood flow in a placental functional unit (a placentone), describing flow of maternal blood via Darcy's law and steady advective transport of a dissolved nutrient. An analytical method of images and computational integration along streamlines are employed to find flow and solute concentration distributions, which are illustrated for a range of governing system parameters. Predictions of the model agree with experimental radioangiographic studies of tracer dynamics in the intervillous space. The model supports the hypothesis that basal veins are located on the periphery of the placentone in order to optimise delivery of nutrients. We also explain the importance of dilatation of maternal spiral arteries and suggest the existence of an optimal volume fraction of villous tissue, which can both be involved in the placental dysfunction. Theoretical studies of this thesis thus constitute a step towards modelling-based diagnostics and treatment of placental disorders.},

Maternal blood flows between the densely packed branches of villous trees, within which are foetal vessels. Here, we explore some of the challenges in modelling maternal haemodynamic transport using homogenization approaches. We first show how two measures can be used to estimate the minimum distance over which the distribution of villous branches appears statistically homogeneous. We then analyse a simplified model problem (solute transport by a unidirectional flow past a distribution of point sinks) to assess the accuracy of homogenization approximations as a function of governing parameters (Péclet and Damköhler numbers) and the statistical properties of the sink distribution. The difference between the leading-order homogenization approximation and the exact solute distribution is characterized by large spatial gradients at the scale of individual villi and substantial fluctuations that can be correlated over lengthscales comparable to the whole domain. This study highlights the importance of quantifying errors owing to spatial disorder in multi-scale approximations of physiological systems.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In pregnancy, fetal growth is supported by its placenta. In turn, the placenta is nourished by maternal blood, delivered from the uterus, in which the vasculature is dramatically transformed to deliver this blood an ever increasing volume throughout gestation. A healthy pregnancy is thus dependent on the development of both the placental and maternal circulations, but also the interface where these physically separate circulations come in close proximity to exchange gases and nutrients between mum and baby. As the system continually evolves during pregnancy, our understanding of normal vascular anatomy, and how this impacts placental exchange function is limited. Understanding this is key to improve our ability to understand, predict, and detect pregnancy pathologies, but presents a number of challenges, due to the inaccessibility of the pregnant uterus to invasive measurements, and limitations in the resolution of imaging modalities safe for use in pregnancy. Computational approaches provide an opportunity to gain new insights into normal and abnormal pregnancy, by connecting observed anatomical changes from high‐resolution imaging to function, and providing metrics that can be observed by routine clinical ultrasound. Such advanced modeling brings with it challenges to scale detailed anatomical models to reflect organ level function. This suggests pathways for future research to provide models that provide both physiological insights into pregnancy health, but also are simple enough to guide clinical focus. We the review evolution of computational approaches to understanding the physiology and pathophysiology of pregnancy in the uterus, placenta, and beyond focusing on both opportunities and challenges.

  abstract = {The placenta provides all the nutrients required for the fetus through pregnancy. It develops dynamically, and, to avoid rejection of the fetus, there is no mixing of fetal and maternal blood; rather, the branched placental villi ‘bathe’ in blood supplied from the uterine arteries. Within the villi, the feto–placental vasculature also develops a complex branching structure in order to maximize exchange between the placental and maternal circulations. To understand the development of the placenta, we must translate functional information across spatial scales including the interaction between macro- and micro-scale haemodynamics and account for the effects of a dynamically and rapidly changing structure through the time course of pregnancy. Here, we present steps towards an anatomically based and multiscale approach to modelling the feto–placental circulation. We assess the effect of the location of cord insertion on feto–placental blood flow resistance and flow heterogeneity and show that, although cord insertion does not appear to directly influence feto–placental resistance, the heterogeneity of flow in the placenta is predicted to increase from a 19.4\% coefficient of variation with central cord insertion to 23.3\% when the cord is inserted 2 cm from the edge of the placenta. Model geometries with spheroidal and ellipsoidal shapes, but the same volume, showed no significant differences in flow resistance or heterogeneity, implying that normal asymmetry in shape does not affect placental efficiency. However, the size and number of small capillary vessels is predicted to have a large effect on feto–placental resistance and flow heterogeneity. Using this new model as an example, we highlight the importance of taking an integrated multi-disciplinary and multiscale approach to understand development of the placenta.},

  abstract = {In this work, we consider the spatial homogenization of a coupled transport and fluid–structure interaction model, to the end of deriving a system of effective equations describing the flow, elastic deformation and transport in an active poroelastic medium. The ‘active’ nature of the material results from a morphoelastic response to a chemical stimulant, in which the growth time scale is strongly separated from other elastic time scales. The resulting effective model is broadly relevant to the study of biological tissue growth, geophysical flows (e.g. swelling in coals and clays) and a wide range of industrial applications (e.g. absorbant hygiene products). The key contribution of this work is the derivation of a system of homogenized partial differential equations describing macroscale growth, coupled to transport of solute, that explicitly incorporates details of the structure and dynamics of the microscopic system, and, moreover, admits finite growth and deformation at the pore scale. The resulting macroscale model comprises a Biot-type system, augmented with additional terms pertaining to growth, coupled to an advection–reaction–diffusion equation. The resultant system of effective equations is then compared with other recent models under a selection of appropriate simplifying asymptotic limits.},

Maternal supine position in late pregnancy reduces maternal cardiac output and uterine blood flow.                                                           Using MRI, this study shows that compared to the left lateral position, maternal supine position in late pregnancy is associated with reduced utero‐placental blood flow and oxygen transfer across the placenta with an average 6.2\% reduction in oxygen delivery to the fetus and an average 11\% reduction in fetal umbilical venous blood flow.                                                                                            Abstract                                Maternal sleep position in late gestation is associated with an increased risk of stillbirth, though the pathophysiological reasons for this are unclear. Studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have shown that compared with lateral positions, lying supine causes a reduction in cardiac output, reduced abdominal aortic blood flow and reduced vena caval flow which is only partially compensated for by increased flow in the azygos venous system. Using functional MRI techniques, including an acquisition termed diffusion–relaxation combined imaging of the placenta (DECIDE), which combines diffusion weighted imaging and T2 relaxometry, blood flow and oxygen transfer were estimated in the maternal, fetal and placental compartments when subjects were scanned both supine and in left lateral positions. In late gestation pregnancy, lying supine caused a 23.7\% (                 P                 ~{$<~$}0.0001) reduction in total internal iliac arterial blood flow to the uterus. In addition, lying in the supine position caused a 6.2\% (                 P                 ~=~0.038) reduction in oxygen movement across the placenta. The reductions in oxygen transfer to the fetus, termed delivery flux, of 11.2\% (                 P                 ~=~0.0597) and in fetal oxygen saturation of 4.4\% (                 P                 ~=~0.0793) did not reach statistical significance. It is concluded that even in healthy late gestation pregnancy, maternal position significantly affects oxygen transfer across the placenta and may in part provide an explanation for late stillbirth in vulnerable fetuses.                                       ,              Key points                                                                Maternal supine sleep position in late pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of stillbirth.                                                     Maternal supine position in late pregnancy reduces maternal cardiac output and uterine blood flow.                                                     Using MRI, this study shows that compared to the left lateral position, maternal supine position in late pregnancy is associated with reduced utero‐placental blood flow and oxygen transfer across the placenta with an average 6.2\% reduction in oxygen delivery to the fetus and an average 11\% reduction in fetal umbilical venous blood flow.},

Current neonatal care is associated with significant morbidity due to iatrogenic injury and developmental immaturity of extreme premature infants. A more physiologic approach, replacing placental function and providing a womb‐like environment, is the foundational principle of artificial placenta (AP) and womb (AW) technology. The concept has been studied during the past 60\,years with limited success. However, recent technological advancements and a greater emphasis on mimicking utero‐placental physiology have improved the success of experimental models, bringing the technology closer to clinical translation. Here, we review the rationale for and history of AP and AW technology, discuss the challenges that needed to be overcome, and compare recent successful models. We conclude by outlining some remaining challenges to be addressed on the path towards clinical translation and opportunities for future research.},

  abstract = {Significance             During pregnancy, the placenta functions as surrogate fetal lungs, kidneys, and gut. Proper placental functioning is therefore paramount during embryonic development. Indeed, placental defects are highly prevalent in mouse mutants showing embryonic death. Here we validate a contrast agent that allows development of the intact placenta to be visualized using microfocus computed topography. This technique enables an initial 3D inspection of the overall placental structure and provides the possibility to quantify different compartments in the placenta. Moreover, the nondestructive nature of this contrast agent permits further histological processing of the same sample when defects are observed.           ,                             Genetic engineering of the mouse genome identified many genes that are essential for embryogenesis. Remarkably, the prevalence of concomitant placental defects in embryonic lethal mutants is highly underestimated and indicates the importance of detailed placental analysis when phenotyping new individual gene knockouts. Here we introduce high-resolution contrast-enhanced microfocus computed tomography (CE-CT) as a nondestructive, high-throughput technique to evaluate the 3D placental morphology. Using a contrast agent, zirconium-substituted Keggin polyoxometalate (Zr-POM), the soft tissue of the placenta (i.e., different layers and cell types and its vasculature) was imaged with a resolution of 3.5 µm voxel size. This approach allowed us to visualize and study early and late stages of placental development. Moreover, CE-CT provides a method to precisely quantify placental parameters (i.e., volumes, volume fraction, ratio of different placental layers, and volumes of specific cell populations) that are crucial for statistical comparison studies. The CE-CT assessment of the 3D morphology of the placentas was validated (               i               ) by comparison with standard histological studies; (               ii               ) by evaluating placentas from 2 different mouse strains, 129S6 and C57BL/6J mice; and (               iii               ) by confirming the placental phenotype of mice lacking phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-p110α. Finally, the Zr-POM–based CE-CT allowed for inspection of the vasculature structure in the entire placenta, as well as detecting placental defects in pathologies characterized by embryonic resorption and placental fusion. Taken together, Zr-POM–based CE-CT offers a quantitative 3D methodology to investigate placental development or pathologies.},

  abstract = {The primary exchange units in the human placenta are terminal villi, in which fetal capillary networks are surrounded by a thin layer of villous tissue, separating fetal from maternal blood. To understand how the complex spatial structure of villi influences their function, we use an image-based theoretical model to study the effect of tissue metabolism on the transport of solutes from maternal blood into the fetal circulation. For solute that is taken up under first-order kinetics, we show that the transition between flow-limited and diffusion-limited transport depends on two new dimensionless parameters defined in terms of key geometric quantities, with strong solute uptake promoting flow-limited transport conditions. We present a simple algebraic approximation for solute uptake rate as a function of flow conditions, metabolic rate and villous geometry. For oxygen, accounting for nonlinear kinetics using physiological parameter values, our model predicts that villous metabolism does not significantly impact oxygen transfer to fetal blood, although the partitioning of fluxes between the villous tissue and the capillary network depends strongly on the flow regime.},

We provide asymptotic approximations of the resulting travelling waves in various asymptotic limits of the wavespeed, the non-local interaction strength, and the moving boundary condition. Crucially, we find that when the moving boundary has a weak interactive strength with the population density flux, there can be two different travelling wave solutions that move at the same wavespeed.},

  abstract = {Purpose               Motion correction in placental DW‐MRI is challenging due to maternal breathing motion, maternal movements, and rapid intensity changes. Parameter estimates are usually obtained using least‐squares methods for voxel‐wise fitting; however, they typically give noisy estimates due to low signal‐to‐noise ratio. We introduce a model‐driven registration (MDR) technique which incorporates a placenta‐specific signal model into the registration process, and we present a Bayesian approach for Diffusion‐rElaxation Combined Imaging for Detailed placental Evaluation model to obtain individual and population trends in estimated parameters.                                         Methods               MDR exploits the fact that a placenta signal model is available and thus we incorporate it into the registration to generate a series of target images. The proposed registration method is compared to a pre‐existing method used for DCE‐MRI data making use of principal components analysis. The Bayesian shrinkage prior (BSP) method has no user‐defined parameters and therefore measures of parameter variation in a region of interest are determined by the data alone. The MDR method and the Bayesian approach were evaluated on 10 control 4D DW‐MRI singleton placental data.                                         Results                                MDR method improves the alignment of placenta data compared to the pre‐existing method. It also shows a further reduction of the residual error between the data and the fit. BSP approach showed higher precision leading to more clearly apparent spatial features in the parameter maps. Placental fetal oxygen saturation (FO                 2                 ) showed a negative linear correlation with gestational age.                                                        Conclusions               The proposed pipeline provides a robust framework for registering DW‐MRI data and analyzing longitudinal changes of placental function.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of building fast and reliable 3D reconstruction methods for blood flows for which partial information is given by Doppler ultrasound measurements. This task is of interest in medicine since it could enrich the available information used in the diagnosis of certain diseases which is currently based essentially on the measurements coming from ultrasound devices. The fast reconstruction of the full flow can be performed with state estimation methods that have been introduced in recent years and that involve reduced order models. One simple and efficient strategy is the so-called Parametrized Background Data-Weak approach (PBDW). It is a linear mapping that consists in a least squares fit between the measurement data and a linear reduced model to which a certain correction term is added. However, in the original approach, the reduced model is built a priori and independently of the reconstruction task (typically with a proper orthogonal decomposition or a greedy algorithm). In this paper, we investigate the construction of other reduced spaces which are built to be better adapted to the reconstruction task and which result in mappings that are sometimes nonlinear. We compare the performance of the different algorithms on numerical experiments involving synthetic Doppler measurements. The results illustrate the superiority of the proposed alternatives to the classical linear PBDW approach.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Metabolic changes in obese pregnant women, such as changes of plasma lipids beyond physiological levels, may subsequently affect fetal development in utero. These metabolic derangements may remain in the offspring and continue throughout life. The placenta mediates bidirectional exchange of nutrients between mother and fetus. The impact of prepregnancy obesity on placental transfer of lipids is still unknown.                                         Objective                                We aimed to examine materno-to-fetal free fatty acid (FFA) transfer by a combined experimental and modeling approach. Flux of                 13                 C-labeled FFA was evaluated by ex vivo perfusion of human placentae as a function of prepregnancy obesity. Mathematical modeling complemented ex vivo results by providing FFA kinetic parameters.                                                        Results                                Obesity was strongly associated with elevated materno-to-fetal transfer of applied                 13                 C-FFA. Clearance of polyunsaturated                 13                 C-docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was most prominently affected. The use of the mathematical model revealed a lower tissue storage capacity for DHA in obese compared with lean placentae.                                                        Conclusion               Besides direct materno-to-fetal FFA transfer, placental mobilization accounts for the fetal FA supply. Together, with metabolic changes in the mother and an elevated materno-fetal FFA transfer shown in obesity, these changes suggest that they may be transmitted to the fetus, with yet unknown consequences.},

  abstract = {Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been proven to be a safe and powerful tool for investigating the small scale motion of blood as it moves throughout the human placenta in utero, using techniques such as Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) which have been proven to be sensitive to placental haemodynamics and changes in placental insufficiency. However due to the complexity of the human placenta, and the sensitivity of DWI to flow effects interpreting the results of DWI in utero is challenging, as within a single voxel many haemodynamic features can combine, such as blood percolating across the intervillous space, turbulent blood supplied by the spiral arteries and the fetal circulation within the villous tree network. The direct effect of these processes combining is not obvious, and while DWI has been shown to be sensitive to placental dysfunction it is not always clear how changes in signal reflect changes in structure. This thesis investigates the placental DWI response further, initially through the use of an Inverse Laplace Transform (ILT) based approach to fit the data and provide more understanding of the slow diffusive, and faster ?pseudodiffusive? components, where I found multiple components, which were altered in placental dysfunction. I then fitted the same data using a more popular Intra-Voxel Incoherent Motion IVIM model, and made the first comparisons between data fit with an ILT based approach, and an IVIM model, to provide more context to what IVIM parameters are measuring within the placental DWI data. While I found that the ILT provided more information about the faster incoherent motion of blood, the IVIM model still provides similar information through easier to fit and interpret parameter maps. This thesis outlines the first implementation of Phase Contrast Angiography (PCA) for measurement of the velocity of blood within the placenta, which was used to provide better understanding of placental haemodynamics. Importantly I found that the speed of blood in placentas with insufficiency (namely Pre Eclampsia (PE) and Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR)) was significantly faster than in those without. These measurements were also used to provide more context to DWI measures as the bulk flow of blood throughout the organ is also important for ensuring proper development and function of the placenta. This thesis also outlines the first measurements of the poorly understood venous drainage system using MRI, which has seen little attention but must also be important for sustaining the placental environment. The presence of ?rebounds? in placental Pulse Gradient Spin Echo (PGSE) data, where voxels which begin decaying (as in normal DWI) begin to regain a proportion of the initial signal intensity. Rebounds have theoretically been shown to be possible but have yet to be reported in experimental data, however I believe the rebounds presented here are not of the same form as those previously described, and instead were due to flow effects within the placenta. Here I introduced a method for identifying these voxels, and providing quantitative information about the underlying flow. Finally, as all the results presented here are expected to depend on the exact properties of the PGSE sequence used, I investigated how the response of the placental DWI results presented here could vary with diffusion time (?). This work could only be carried out in an imaging phantom due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and while it showed promise and outlined a method to combine diffusion encoded, and flow encoded measurements into a single set of imaging gradients to better investigate the placental environment, the work needs to be repeated in utero.},

In humans, fetal blood flows through intricate networks of vessels confined within villous trees, the branches of which are bathed in pools of maternal blood. Fluid mechanics and transport processes play a central role in understanding how these elaborate structures contribute to the function of the placenta and how their disorganization may lead to disease. Recent advances in imaging and computation have spurred significant advances in simulations of fetal and maternal flows within the placenta across a range of length scales. Models describe jets of maternal blood emerging from spiral arteries into a disordered and deformable porous medium, as well as solute uptake by fetal blood flowing through elaborate three-dimensional capillary networks. We survey recent developments and emerging challenges in modeling flow and transport in this complex organ.},

  abstract = {Summary             Matrix acidizing is a common technique for carbonate reservoir stimulation. In this work, a new two-scale continuum model is developed to study the 2D acidizing process. The Navier-Stokes-Darcy equation is used instead of the Darcy’s-law equation to describe fluid flow. The continuity equation is also modified to consider the mass-exchange term between fluid and solid phases. The comparison results show that neglecting the solid-matrix-dissolution source term results in overestimation of pore volume (PV) to breakthrough (PVBT). The Darcy’s-law equation does not well-capture physical behaviors of fluid phase with low acid-injection velocity compared with the Navier-Stokes-Darcy equation. On the basis of this model, we discuss different processes influencing matrix acidizing, including convection, diffusion, and reaction, and different models, including classical and new two-scale continuum models. Besides, a comprehensive parametric study is also conducted to study the effect of parameters with respect to acid and rock physical parameters on the matrix-acidizing process. The typical dissolution patterns and optimal acid-injection rate presented in experimental studies can be well-observed by the new two-scale continuum model. Increasing the acid-injection concentration has a limited effect on the amount of acid mass but substantially reduces the amount of solute required. The acidizing curve is very sensitive to the dispersity coefficient, acid-surface-reaction rate, and porosity/permeability relationship.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The spin echo sequence is a fundamental pulse sequence in MRI. Many of today's applications in routine clinical use are based on this elementary sequence. In this review article, the principles of the spin echo formation are demonstrated on which the generation of the fundamental image contrasts T               1               , T               2               , and proton density is based. The basic imaging parameters repetition time (TR) and echo time (TE) and their influence on the image contrast are explained. Important properties such as the behavior in multi‐slice imaging or in the presence of flow are depicted and the basic differences with gradient echo imaging are illustrated. The characteristics of the spin echo sequence for different magnetic field strengths with respect to clinical applications are discussed. J. Magn. Reson.

  abstract = {Abstract             The placenta mediates physiological exchange between the mother and the fetus. In placental mammals, all placentas are descended from a single common ancestor and functions are conserved across species; however, the placenta exhibits radical structural diversity. The selective pressures behind this structural diversity are poorly understood. Traditionally, placental structures have largely been investigated by grouping them into qualitative categories. Assessing the placenta on this basis could be problematic when inferring the relative “efficiency” of a placental configuration to transfer nutrients from mother to fetus. We argue that only by considering placentas as three-dimensional (3D) biological structures, integrated across scales, can the evolutionary questions behind their enormous structural diversity be quantitatively determined. We review the current state of placental evolution from a structural perspective, detail where 3D imaging and computational modeling have been used to gain insight into placental function, and outline an experimental roadmap to answer evolutionary questions from a multiscale 3D structural perspective. Our approach aims to shed light on placental evolution, and can be transferred to evolutionary investigations in any organ system.},

Although oxygen tension is an important limiting parameter in the development of new cartilage matrix, its precise role in matrix formation by chondrocytes remains controversial, primarily due to discrepancies in the experimental setup applied in different studies. In this study, the specific effects of oxygen tension on the synthesis of cartilaginous matrix by human articular chondrocytes were studied using a combined experimental‐computational approach in a “scaffold‐free” 3D pellet culture model. Key parameters including cellular oxygen uptake rate were determined experimentally and used in conjunction with a mathematical model to estimate oxygen tension profiles in 21‐day cartilaginous pellets. A threshold oxygen tension (pO                 2                 \,≈\,8\% atmospheric pressure) for human articular chondrocytes was estimated from these inferred oxygen profiles and histological analysis of pellet sections. Human articular chondrocytes that experienced oxygen tension below this threshold demonstrated enhanced proteoglycan deposition. Conversely, oxygen tension higher than the threshold favored collagen synthesis. This study has demonstrated a close relationship between oxygen tension and matrix synthesis by human articular chondrocytes in a “scaffold‐free” 3D pellet culture model, providing valuable insight into the understanding and optimization of cartilage bioengineering approaches.

  abstract = {SUMMARY             Children born with single ventricle heart defects typically undergo a staged surgical procedure culminating in a total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) or Fontan surgery. The goal of this work was to perform physiologic, patient‐specific hemodynamic simulations of two post‐operative TCPC patients by using fluid–structure interaction (FSI) simulations. Data from two patients are presented, and post‐op anatomy is reconstructed from MRI data. Respiration rate, heart rate, and venous pressures are obtained from catheterization data, and inflow rates are obtained from phase contrast MRI data and are used together with a respiratory model. Lumped parameter (Windkessel) boundary conditions are used at the outlets. We perform FSI simulations by using an arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian finite element framework to account for motion of the blood vessel walls in the TCPC. This study is the first to introduce variable elastic properties for the different areas of the TCPC, including a Gore‐Tex conduit. Quantities such as wall shear stresses and pressures at critical locations are extracted from the simulation and are compared with pressure tracings from clinical data as well as with rigid wall simulations. Hepatic flow distribution and energy efficiency are also calculated and compared for all cases. There is little effect of FSI on pressure tracings, hepatic flow distribution, and time‐averaged energy efficiency. However, the effect of FSI on wall shear stress, instantaneous energy efficiency, and wall motion is significant and should be considered in future work, particularly for accurate prediction of thrombus formation.

Models differ in terms of shape (intra- or extra-cardiac conduit) and cross section (with or without patch enlargement) of the inferior caval (IVC) anastomosis connection. Realistic pulsatile flows were submitted to both the venae cavae, while porous portions were added at the end of the pulmonary arteries to reproduce the pulmonary afterload. The dissipated power and the flow distribution into the lungs were calculated at different values of pulmonary arteriolar resistances (PAR). The most important results are: i) power dissipation in different TCPC designs is influenced by the actual cross sectional area of the IVC anastomosis and ii) the inclusion of a patch minimizes the dissipated power (range 4–13 mW vs. 14–56 mW). Results also show that the perfusion of the right lung is between 15\% and 30\% of the whole IVC blood flow when the PAR are evenly distributed between the right and the left lung.},

  abstract = {Abstract An improvement of a new technique for modelling cracks in the finite element framework is presented. A standard displacement-based approximation is enriched near a crack by incorporating both discontinuous fields and the near tip asymptotic fields through a partition of unity method. A methodology that constructs the enriched approximation from the interaction of the crack geometry with the mesh is developed. This technique allows the entire crack to be represented independently of the mesh, and so remeshing is not necessary to model crack growth. Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the utility and robustness of the proposed technique. Copyright © 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {A supply of glucose to a nervous tissue is fulfilled by a cerebrovascular network, and further diffusion is known to occur at both an arteriolar and a microvascular level. Despite a direct relation, a blood flow dynamic and reaction-diffusion of metabolites are usually considered separately in the mathematical models. In the present study they are coupled in a multiphysical approach which allows to evaluate the effects of capillary blood flow changes on near-vessels nutrient concentration gradients evidently. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was described by the non-steady-state Navier-Stokes equations for a non-Newtonian fluid whose constitutive law is given by the Carreau model. A three-level organization of blood–brain barrier (BBB) is modelled by the flux dysconnectivity functions including densities and kinetic properties of glucose transporters. The velocity of a fluid flow in brain extracellular space (ECS) was estimated using Darcy’s law. The equations of reaction-diffusion with convection based on a generated flow field for continues and porous media were used to describe spatial-time gradients of glucose in the capillary lumen and brain parenchyma of a neurovascular unit (NVU), respectively. Changes in CBF were directly simulated using smoothing step-like functions altering the difference of intracapillary pressure in time. The changes of CBF cover both the decrease (on 70\%) and the increase (on 50\%) in a capillary flow velocity. Analyzing the dynamics of glucose gradients, it was shown that a rapid decrease of a capillary blood flow yields an enhanced level of glucose in a near-capillary nervous tissue if the contacts between astrocytes end-feet are not tight. Under the increased CBF velocities the amplitude of glucose concentration gradients is always enhanced. The introduced approach can be used for estimation of blood flow changes influence not only on glucose but also on other nutrients concentration gradients and for the modelling of distributions of their concentrations near blood vessels in other tissues as well.},

  abstract = {This thesis explores the development and analysis of moving mesh Virtual Element Methods for partial differential equations on time-dependent domains. This thesis presents the first moving mesh method to purely use the Virtual Element Method, an isoparametric Virtual Element Method for approximating partial differential equations on curved domains and a high-order Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian Virtual Element Method for problems on time-dependent domains with moving boundaries. Each contribution successfully demonstrates the applicability and accuracy of Virtual Element Methods in existing moving mesh algorithms, achieving similar orders of accuracy compared to classical Finite Element Method approaches. The results suggest that the flexibility of moving mesh methods can be greatly improved by incorporating more general mesh structures, including polygons and curved-edged polygons, proving the Virtual Element Method offers an effective extension to classical approaches. This work provides a foundation for future research in Virtual Element Methods for more complex problems on time-dependent domains and developing the analysis to support proposed moving mesh methods.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The placenta is crucial for life. It is an ephemeral but complex organ acting as the barrier interface between maternal and fetal circulations, providing exchange of gases, nutrients, hormones, waste products and immunoglobulins. Many gaps exist in our understanding of the detailed placental structure and function, particularly in relation to oxygen handling and transfer in healthy and pathological states               in utero               . Measurements to understand oxygen transfer               in vivo               in the human are limited, with no general agreement on the most appropriate methods. An invasive method for measuring partial pressure of oxygen in the intervillous space through needle electrode insertion at the time of Caesarean sections has been reported. This allows for direct measurements               in vivo               whilst maintaining near normal placental conditions; however, there are practical and ethical implications in using this method for determination of placental oxygenation. Furthermore, oxygen levels are likely to be highly heterogeneous within the placenta. Emerging non‐invasive techniques, such as MRI, and               ex vivo               research are capable of enhancing and improving current imaging methodology for placental villous structure and increase the precision of oxygen measurement within placental compartments. These techniques, in combination with mathematical modelling, have stimulated novel cross‐disciplinary approaches that could advance our understanding of placental oxygenation and its metabolism in normal and pathological pregnancies, improving clinical treatment options and ultimately outcomes for the patient.                                                   image},

  abstract = {In this paper, we consider the derivation of macroscopic equations appropriate to describe the growth of biological tissue, employing a multiple-scale homogenisation method to accommodate explicitly the influence of the underlying microscale structure of the material, and its evolution, on the macroscale dynamics. Such methods have been widely used to study porous and poroelastic materials; however, a distinguishing feature of biological tissue is its ability to remodel continuously in response to local environmental cues. Here, we present the derivation of a model broadly applicable to tissue engineering applications, characterised by cell proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition in porous scaffolds used within tissue culture systems, which we use to study coupling between fluid flow, nutrient transport and microscale tissue growth. Attention is restricted to surface accretion within a rigid porous medium saturated with a Newtonian fluid; coupling between the various dynamics is achieved by specifying the rate of microscale growth to be dependent upon the uptake of a generic diffusible nutrient. The resulting macroscale model comprises a Darcy-type equation governing fluid flow, with flow characteristics dictated by the assumed periodic microstructure and surface growth rate of the porous medium, coupled to an advection--reaction equation specifying the nutrient concentration. Illustrative numerical simulations are presented to indicate the influence of microscale growth on macroscale dynamics, and to highlight the importance of including experimentally-relevant microstructural information in order to correctly determine flow dynamics and nutrient delivery in tissue engineering applications.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Placental function is essential for fetal development and establishing the foundations for lifelong health. The placental villous stroma is a connective tissue layer that supports the fetal capillaries and villous trophoblast. All the nutrients that cross the placenta must also cross the stroma, and yet little is known about this region. This study uses high‐resolution three‐dimensional imaging to explore the structural complexity of this region within the placental villi. Serial block‐face scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy were used to image the placental villous stroma in three‐dimensions. Transmission electron microscopy (               TEM               ) was used to generate high resolution two‐dimensional images. Stereological approaches were used to quantify volumes of stromal constituents. Three‐dimensional imaging identified stromal extracellular vesicles, which constituted 3.9\% of the villous stromal volume. These stromal extracellular vesicles were ovoid in shape, had a median length of 2750~nm (range 350–7730~nm) and               TEM               imaging confirmed that they were bounded by a lipid bilayer. Fifty‐nine per~cent of extracellular vesicles were in contact with a fibroblast‐like stellate cell and these vesicles were significantly larger than those where no contact was observed. These stellate cells formed local networks with adherent junctions observed at contact points. This study demonstrates that the villous stroma contains extracellular macrovesicles which are considerably larger than any previously described in tissue or plasma. The size and abundance of these macrovesicles in the villous stroma highlight the diversity of extracellular vesicle biology and their roles within connective tissues.},

  abstract = {Visualization and quantification of the adverse effects of distorted blood flow are important emerging fields in cardiology. Abnormal blood flow patterns can be seen in various cardiovascular diseases and are associated with increased energy loss. These adverse energetics can be measured and quantified using 3-dimensional blood flow data, derived from computational fluid dynamics and 4-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging, and provide new, promising hemodynamic markers. In patients with palliated single-ventricular heart defects, the Fontan circulation passively directs systemic venous return to the pulmonary circulation in the absence of a functional subpulmonary ventricle. Therefore, the Fontan circulation is highly dependent on favorable flow and energetics, and minimal energy loss is of great importance. A focus on reducing energy loss led to the introduction of the total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) as an alternative to the classical Fontan connection. Subsequently, many studies have investigated energy loss in the TCPC, and energy-saving geometric factors have been implemented in clinical care. Great advances have been made in computational fluid dynamics modeling and can now be done in 3-dimensional patient-specific models with increasingly accurate boundary conditions. Furthermore, the implementation of 4-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging is promising and can be of complementary value to these models. Recently, correlations between energy loss in the TCPC and cardiac parameters and exercise intolerance have been reported. Furthermore, efficiency of blood flow through the TCPC is highly variable, and inefficient blood flow is of clinical importance by reducing cardiac output and increasing central venous pressure, thereby increasing the risk of experiencing the well-known Fontan complications. Energy loss in the TCPC will be an important new hemodynamic parameter in addition to other well-known risk factors such as pulmonary vascular resistance and can possibly be improved by patient-specific surgical design. This article describes the theoretical background of mechanical energy of blood flow in the cardiovascular system and the methods of calculating energy loss, and it gives an overview of geometric factors associated with energy efficiency in the TCPC and its implications on clinical outcome. Furthermore, the role of 4-dimensional flow magnetic resonance imaging and areas of future research are discussed.},

However, limitations in both quantitative and qualitative analyses can result from errors inherent to PC MRI. One method that excels in creating low-error, physics-based, velocity fields is computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Augmentation of cerebral 4D flow MRI data with CFD-informed neural networks may provide a method to produce highly accurate physiological flow fields. In this preliminary study, the potential utility of such a method was demonstrated by using high resolution patient-specific CFD data to train a convolutional neural network, and then using the trained network to enhance MRI-derived velocity fields in cerebral blood vessel data sets. Through testing on simulated images, phantom data, and cerebrovascular 4D flow data from 20 patients, the trained network successfully de-noised flow images, decreased velocity error, and enhanced near-vessel-wall velocity quantification and visualization. Such image enhancement can improve experimental and clinical qualitative and quantitative cerebrovascular PC MRI analysis.},

  abstract = {Spiral arteries (SAs) lie at the interface between the uterus and placenta, and supply nutrients to the placental surface. Maternal blood circulation is separated from the fetal circulation by structures called villous trees. SAs are transformed in early pregnancy from tightly coiled vessels to large high-capacity channels, which is believed to facilitate an increased maternal blood flow throughout pregnancy with minimal increase in velocity, preventing damage to delicate villous trees. Significant maternal blood flow velocities have been theorized in the space surrounding the villi (the intervillous space, IVS), particularly when SA conversion is inadequate, but have only recently been visualized reliably using pulsed wave Doppler ultrasonography. Here, we present a computational model of blood flow from SA openings, allowing prediction of IVS properties based on jet length. We show that jets of flow observed by ultrasound are likely correlated with increased IVS porosity near the SA mouth and propose that observed mega-jets (flow penetrating more than half the placental thickness) are only possible when SAs open to regions of the placenta with very sparse villous structures. We postulate that IVS tissue density must decrease at the SA mouth through gestation, supporting the hypothesis that blood flow from SAs influences villous tree development.},

  abstract = {Amino acid transfer from mother to fetus via the placenta plays a critical role in normal development, and restricted transfer is associated with fetal growth restriction. Placental amino acid transfer involves the interaction of 15 or more transporters and 20 amino acids. This complexity means that knowing which transporters are present is not sufficient to predict how they operate together as a system. Therefore, in order to investigate how placental amino acid transfer occurs as a system, an integrated mathematical/computational modelling framework was developed to represent the simultaneous transport of multiple amino acids. The approach was based on a compartmental model, in which separate maternal, syncytiotrophoblast and fetal volumes were distinguished, and transporters were modelled on the maternal‐ and fetal‐facing membranes of the syncytiotrophoblast using Michaelis–Menten‐type kinetics. The model was tested in comparison with placental perfusion experiments studying serine–alanine exchange and found to correspond well. The results demonstrated how the different transporters can work together as an integrated system and allowed their relative importance to be assessed. Placental–fetal serine exchange was found to be most sensitive to basal membrane transporter characteristics, but a range of secondary, less intuitive effects were also revealed. While this work only addressed a relatively simple three amino acid system, it demonstrates the feasibility of the approach and could be extended to incorporate additional experimental parameters. Ultimately, this approach will allow physiological simulations of amino acid transfer. This will enhance our understanding of these complex systems and placental function in health and disease.},

A nonlinear biphasic displacement-velocity-pressure description was combined with adjective and diffusive solute transport, uptake and biosynthesis. To illustrate the approach we focused on the synthesis and transport of macromolecules under influence of fluid flow induced by cyclic compression. In order to produce net transport the effect of dispersion was investigated. An abstract representation of biosynthesis was employed, three cases were distinguished: Synthesis dependent on a limited small solute, synthesis dependent on a limited large solute and synthesis independent of solute transport. Results show that a dispersion model can account for augmented solute transport by cyclic compression and indicate the different sensitivity to loading that can be expected depending on the size of the limiting solute.},

To provide accurate estimates of respiratory gas exchange rates, placenta models need to account for both the physiology of exchange and the organ morphology. While the former has been extensively studied, accounting for the latter is still a challenge. The geometrical complexity of placental structure requires use of carefully crafted approximations. We present here the state of the art of respiratory gas exchange placenta modeling and demonstrate the influence of the morphology description on model predictions. Advantages and shortcomings of various classes of models are discussed, and experimental techniques that may be used for model validation are summarized. Several directions for future development are suggested.},

  abstract = {Airway remodeling occurs in chronic asthma leading to increased airway smooth muscle (ASM) mass and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. Although extensively studied in murine airways, studies report only selected larger airways at one time-point meaning the spatial distribution and resolution of remodeling are poorly understood. Here we use a new method allowing comprehensive assessment of the spatial and temporal changes in ASM, ECM, and epithelium in large numbers of murine airways after allergen challenge. Using image processing to analyze 20–50 airways per mouse from a whole lung section revealed increases in ASM and ECM after allergen challenge were greater in small and large rather than intermediate airways. ASM predominantly accumulated adjacent to the basement membrane, whereas ECM was distributed across the airway wall. Epithelial hyperplasia was most marked in small and intermediate airways. After challenge, ASM changes resolved over 7 days, whereas ECM and epithelial changes persisted. The new method suggests large and small airways remodel differently, and the long-term consequences of airway inflammation may depend more on ECM and epithelial changes than ASM. The improved quantity and quality of unbiased data provided by the method reveals important spatial differences in remodeling and could set new analysis standards for murine asthma models.},

FGR placentae frequently exhibit poor vascular branching, but the mechanisms driving this are poorly understood. We hypothesize that vascular structural malformation at the organ level alters microvascular shear stress, impairing angiogenesis. A computational model of placental vasculature predicted elevated placental micro-vascular shear stress in FGR placentae (0.2\,Pa in severe FGR vs 0.05\,Pa in normal placentae). Endothelial cells cultured under predicted FGR shear stresses migrated significantly slower and with greater persistence than in shear stresses predicted in normal placentae. These cell behaviors suggest a dominance of vessel elongation over branching. Taken together, these results suggest (1) poor vascular development increases vessel shear stress, (2) increased shear stress induces cell behaviors that impair capillary branching angiogenesis, and (3) impaired branching angiogenesis continues to drive elevated shear stress, jeopardizing further vascular formation. Inadequate vascular branching early in gestation could kick off this cyclic loop and continue to negatively impact placental angiogenesis throughout gestation.},

Using the human placenta as an example, this study brings together sophisticated sample preparation protocols, advanced imaging and robust, validated machine-learning segmentation techniques to provide the first massively multi-scale and multi-domain information that enables detailed morphological and functional analyses of both maternal and fetal placental domains. Finally, we quantify the scale-dependent error in morphological metrics of heterogeneous placental tissue, estimating the minimal tissue scale needed in extracting meaningful biological data. The developed protocol is beneficial for high-throughput investigation of structure–function relationships in both normal and diseased placentas, allowing us to optimize therapeutic approaches for pathological pregnancies. In addition, the methodology presented is applicable in the characterization of tissue architecture and physiological behaviours of other complex organs with similarity to the placenta, where an exchange barrier possesses circulating vascular and avascular fluid spaces.},

Waves carry information about the matter in which they propagate. Therefore, modeling of arterial wave propagation extends our knowledge about the functioning of the cardiovascular system and provides a means to diagnose disorders and predict the outcome of medical interventions. In this review we focus on the physical and mathematical modeling of pulse wave propagation, based on general fluid dynamical principles. In addition we present potential applications in cardiovascular research and clinical practice. Models of short- and long-term adaptation of the arterial system and methods that deal with uncertainties in personalized model parameters and boundary conditions are briefly discussed, as they are believed to be major topics for further study and will boost the significance of arterial pulse wave modeling even more.},

  abstract = {Background—                              We previously demonstrated that power loss (PL) through the total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) in single-ventricle patients undergoing Fontan can be calculated by computational fluid dynamic analysis using 3-dimensional MRI anatomic reconstructions. PL through the TCPC may play a role in single-ventricle physiology and is a function of cardiac output. We hypothesized that PL through the TCPC increases significantly under exercise flow conditions.                                                          Methods and Results—                              MRI data of 10 patients with a TCPC were analyzed to obtain 3-dimensional geometry and flow rates through the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, left pulmonary artery, and right pulmonary artery. Steady computational fluid dynamic simulations were performed at baseline conditions using MRI-derived flows. Simulated exercise conditions of twice (2×) and three times (3×) baseline flow were performed by increasing inferior vena cava flow. PL, head loss, and effective resistance through the TCPC were calculated for each condition. Each condition was repeated at left pulmonary artery/right pulmonary artery ratios of 30/70 and 70/30 to determine the effects of pulmonary flow splits on exercise PL. For each patient, PL increases dramatically in a nonlinear fashion with increasing cardiac output, even when normalized to calculate head loss or resistance. Flow splits had a significant effect on PL at exercise, with most geometries favoring right pulmonary artery flow.                                                          Conclusions—                              The relationship between cardiac output and PL is nonlinear and highly dependent on TCPC geometry and pulmonary flow splits. This study demonstrates the importance of studying the TCPC under exercise conditions, because baseline conditions may not adequately characterize TCPC efficiency.},

We propose a self-adaptive preferential flow control mechanism by using dispersed polymers, which is supported strongly by experimental and numerical evidence. Our experiments are performed on a microchip with heterogeneous porous structures where oil is displaced by dispersed polymer microsphere particles. Even though the size of the particles is much smaller than the pore-throat size, the diversion effect by the dispersed microspheres is still proved. Therefore, the plugging effect is not the major mechanism for preferential flow control by dispersed polymers. The mechanisms are further investigated by pore-scale modelling, which indicates that the dispersed polymers exhibit an adaption ability to pressure and resistance in the porous flow field. In such an intelligent way, the displacing fluid with dispersed polymers smartly controls the preferential flow by inducing pressure fluctuations, and demonstrates better performance in both efficiency and economic aspects than the traditional method by simply increasing the viscosity. These insights can be applied to improve techniques in the field, such as enhanced oil recovery and soil wetting.},

  abstract = {Computational hemodynamic simulations are becoming increasingly important for cardiovascular research and clinical practice, yet incorporating numerical simulations of human fetal circulation is relatively underutilized and underdeveloped. The fetus possesses unique vascular shunts to appropriately distribute oxygen and nutrients acquired from the placenta, adding complexity and adaptability to blood flow patterns within the fetal vascular network. Perturbations to fetal circulation compromise fetal growth and trigger the abnormal cardiovascular remodeling that underlies congenital heart defects. Computational modeling can be used to elucidate complex blood flow patterns in the fetal circulatory system for normal versus abnormal development. We present an overview of fetal cardiovascular physiology and its evolution from being investigated with invasive experiments and primitive imaging techniques to advanced imaging (4D MRI and ultrasound) and computational modeling. We introduce the theoretical backgrounds of both lumped-parameter networks and three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic simulations of the cardiovascular system. We subsequently summarize existing modeling studies of human fetal circulation along with their limitations and challenges. Finally, we highlight opportunities for improved fetal circulation models.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of blood flow in the smallest vessels and passages of the human body, where the cellular character of blood becomes prominent, plays a dominant role in the transport and exchange of solutes. Recent studies have revealed that the microhaemodynamics of a vascular network is underpinned by its interconnected structure, and certain structural alterations such as capillary dilation and blockage can substantially change blood flow patterns. However, for extravascular media with disordered microstructure (e.g. the porous intervillous space in the placenta), it remains unclear how the medium’s structure affects the haemodynamics. Here, we simulate cellular blood flow in simple models of canonical porous media representative of extravascular biological tissue, with corroborative microfluidic experiments performed for validation purposes. For the media considered here, we observe three main effects: first, the relative apparent viscosity of blood increases with the structural disorder of the medium; second, the presence of red blood cells (RBCs) dynamically alters the flow distribution in the medium; third, symmetry breaking introduced by moderate structural disorder can promote more homogeneous distribution of RBCs. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the cell-scale haemodynamics that mediates the relationship linking the function of certain biological tissues to their microstructure.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The aim of this paper is to introduce a new mathematical model that simulates myocardial blood perfusion that accounts for multiscale and multiphysics features. Our model incorporates cardiac electrophysiology, active and passive mechanics, hemodynamics, valve modeling, and a multicompartment Darcy model of perfusion. We consider a fully coupled electromechanical model of the left heart that provides input for a fully coupled Navier–Stokes–Darcy model for myocardial perfusion. The fluid dynamics problem is modeled in a left heart geometry that includes large epicardial coronaries, while the multicompartment Darcy model is set in a biventricular myocardium. Using a realistic and detailed cardiac geometry, our simulations demonstrate the biophysical fidelity of our model in describing cardiac perfusion. Specifically, we successfully validate the model reliability by comparing in-silico coronary flow rates and average myocardial blood flow with clinically established values ranges reported in relevant literature. Additionally, we investigate the impact of a regurgitant aortic valve on myocardial perfusion, and our results indicate a reduction in myocardial perfusion due to blood flow taken away by the left ventricle during diastole. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first instance where electromechanics, hemodynamics, and perfusion are integrated into a single computational framework.},
